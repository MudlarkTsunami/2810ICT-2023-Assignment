One of them is that we're really flexible with check out times. :) While we do work from home, we don't particularly want to broadcast on the internet if we are away from home. That's why our arrival time is always listed as 6pm. Our ""check in"" / ""arrival time"" / ""bag drop"" is all the same thing. It's not like we're a hotel with a team of porters waiting to take your bags any time of the day or night whether we're at home or not. So, if we haven't agreed some alternate arrangements, then we look forward to welcoming you to our home at 6.00pm. While we may be able to arrange some arrival times / bag drops / check ins earlier, we do need to make those arrangements well in advance. So if the 6.00pm check in time isn't your preference, please talk to us about it *before* you make your reservation. :)","Our home is centrally located and an easy walk to everywhere (everywhere you want to go anyways). We also have easy access to trams (light-rail), trains, and ferries which are all conveniently a few minutes walk away. Transport options are great:  There's a bus, the 389, pretty much at our doorstep every 10 minutes. It goes into the City Centre, into Paddington, all the way to Bondi Beach and on to North Bondi - Doesn't get better than that! Trams (""light-rail"") every 12 minutes. - Central Station, Fish Markets, The Star, Chinatown, Glebe - Central to Dulwich Hill. Ferries from Pyrmont Bay, Darling Harbour and Circular Quay are a great way to explore. Trains from Town Hall, Central, and Wynyard.

He's Vinh, and I'm Stuart...

We're big fans of AirBnB for nearly a decade having used it when traveling in the USA not long after AirBnB first started.

Since then we've enjoyed traveling with AirBnB across the US, around Australia, in Hong Kong, and also in Vietnam. We're also hosts.

As guests we're always out & about most of the time and won't be intruding too much.

We're neat & tidy and vibrant conversationalists...

We operate ArtSHINE industries - Australia’s independent Creative Industries Enterprise Acceleration Platform + Launch Pad identifying, advancing, and funding commercially minded and innovative Creative Industries Professionals who focus on art, craft, artisanal making, design, fashion, entertainment, photography, music, writing, film & television, digital technology, and games & interactive content. ArtSHINE also incorporates a coffeehouse and coworking space; CoSydney CoWorking + Project Space, in the City of Sydney’s Chippendale Creative Precinct.

So here's an open invitation to come check us out.

My partner Vinh is a keen traveler who works a lot with artists and designers in his coaching practice. He's the energetic, vibrant one...

I lived in Bolivia for a year as a young man just out of school and have worked in social enterprises and not for profits over the years. I'm the more serious, bookish one (with a wicked sense of humour though). Currently working in financial services too...

One of the things we're keen to do is catch up with some social entrepreneurs, coworkers, not for profits, and microfinanciers.

We're particularly interested social enterprise, coworking, and small business incubators & mentoring projects.

More that happy to answer any questions that you may have.

All the best,

Vinh & Stuart

On the weekends I enjoy getting out and about and just enjoying the outdoors.  I walk alot, swim and sail during the warmer months.  When I have time I also like to do charity work as it keeps me grounded.  Some of my passions are travelling and meeting new people.  I'm a positive person which sees the glass as half full.

My favourite city in the world would have to be NYC and I thoroughly enjoy going back every year, to experience the culture, museums, nightlife, restaurants, shopping and just exploring the great city.

As a house guest I'm pretty quiet, clean, respectful and most probably won't be around much as there is also so much to do and see when someone is travelling.

We present Studio Yindi as the type of space we look for when we are travelling nationally or internationally ourselves.  If we can find places to stay that are excellent value for money then it means we can spend longer travelling for the same budget amount! If you are comfortable with comfortable but sometimes recycled furniture and Ikea style kitchen equipment, and do not expect an apartment styled ready to be published in a trendy home magazine, then you will feel very much at home.   But if you are expecting a 5 star hotel standard of accommodation then you will probably be more comfortable staying at a much more expensive Airbnb site,  or a 5 star hotel in the city centre.","GETTING TO STUDIO YINDI Upon confirming your booking we will provide you with the address and detailed instructions for reaching us by, car, taxi or public transport.

We sometimes share a bottle of wine or a cup of tea/coffee with guests who have time to socialise.   Other guests are on a tight schedule of things to do, including weddings or conferences to attend so we hardly see them. We love having families stay with us.   Children who are into skateboarding will love the sloping chicane course offered by the street where we live.  2 boys from Sweden got very involved with the local skate board mob, and were still in contact with the skateboard mates years after they went home to Stockholm. Soccer, Aussie Rules football, or even cricket is often played by local children on our street,  which has very little through traffic.  But obviously children need to be supervised by their parents when they are playing on the street.","Studio Yindi is located in a very quiet suburban area.

We became Airbnb.com hosts back in December 2010.   I was originally an architect, but worked in IT sales/marketing for the next 30+ years.  Semi-retired now,  I still manage consulting projects involving the Internet for small-medium businesses and some community based campaigns to promote better planning outcomes for the whole community, not just developers and their “top end of town” mates.

I call myself an Internet Architect on my business card these days.  Most of my current projects involve marketing using social media tools.

A born and bred Sydneysider, I lived in UK for 10 years till 1984.  I have done lots of travel in Europe, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, China, Vietnam, Japan, New Zealand, USA. 

Studio Yindi incorporates the things we look for when selecting boutique hotels, pensions, hostels and B&Bs for ourselves - space, privacy, wifi Internet access, reading light at the bedside, comfortable and practical for working while ""on the road"", a bit unusual, a little surprise, and value for money. 

My own preferences are for adventure and off the beaten track, rather than luxury, international 5 star. 

We love meeting travellers from all parts of the world, and helping them enjoy the experience of a first visit to Sydney.

We have lots of experience assisting overseas based friends and colleagues to see the best parts of Sydney, using public transport, and avoiding the expensive tourist services.

Messing about on boats is one of my passions. I have a 7.2 m (24') yacht moored nearby on the harbour and know a lot about the nice parts of our extensive waterways, including its part in Australian history.  I love sharing tips on how to see the best of the harbour, using inexpensive public ferries, plus strolls around Cremorne Point from Mosman Bay, or the 3 - 4 hour walk from the Spit to Manly, via Sydney Harbour National Park.

He's Vinh, and I'm Stuart...

We're big fans of AirBnB for nearly a decade having used it when traveling in the USA not long after AirBnB first started.

Since then we've enjoyed traveling with AirBnB across the US, around Australia, in Hong Kong, and also in Vietnam. We're also hosts.

As guests we're always out & about most of the time and won't be intruding too much.

We're neat & tidy and vibrant conversationalists...

We operate ArtSHINE industries - Australia’s independent Creative Industries Enterprise Acceleration Platform + Launch Pad identifying, advancing, and funding commercially minded and innovative Creative Industries Professionals who focus on art, craft, artisanal making, design, fashion, entertainment, photography, music, writing, film & television, digital technology, and games & interactive content. ArtSHINE also incorporates a coffeehouse and coworking space; CoSydney CoWorking + Project Space, in the City of Sydney’s Chippendale Creative Precinct.

So here's an open invitation to come check us out.

My partner Vinh is a keen traveler who works a lot with artists and designers in his coaching practice. He's the energetic, vibrant one...

I lived in Bolivia for a year as a young man just out of school and have worked in social enterprises and not for profits over the years. I'm the more serious, bookish one (with a wicked sense of humour though). Currently working in financial services too...

One of the things we're keen to do is catch up with some social entrepreneurs, coworkers, not for profits, and microfinanciers.

We're particularly interested social enterprise, coworking, and small business incubators & mentoring projects.

More that happy to answer any questions that you may have.

All the best,

I'm a family man with 3 daughters. When I get any time off from them, I love playing tennis, saxophone and piano and hanging out with friends. Oh, and I also work - I'm afraid I'm very boring as my life's motto is get the work done, then play. But still somehow we get to  travel each year and sometimes stay in other peoples houses and apartments, so I know and appreciate the other side of this (Website hidden by Airbnb) favorite destinations have been Mozambique, Thailand, China, Bali and Argentina. 

But one of the best places to live in this world has to be Coogee, Sydney and I consider myself extremely lucky for that (and for my 3 daughters, of-course). We live 2 blocks away from the Pumpkin (as we call the house listed here), so I am just a minute away if anyone needs help, from a blown light bulb to where to go shopping etc.

I really enjoy the way people are blown away when they first walk into the Pumpkin. Even though they have seen the photos, they are so excited and incredulous about staying there themselves. I also like that when they leave, they report being very satisfied and happy with their stay.

Ever since Airbnb started in 2011, both of us (both separately and together) have listed our home/s in Sydney and (formerly) in Hong Kong.  We've successfully hosted and enjoyed meeting a swag of guests in the Airbnb international community from all cultures—some whom we call friends and continue to stay in contact with. 

As Airbnb hosts, aside from covering the accommodation basics, our style is to be friendly and responsive to the needs of our guests.  Are you a first-time visitor to Sydney who's coming without a full itinerary?  We can give you the local scoop on a lot of great activities that you won't read about online or in your guide books (pottery classes? suggestions for families and kids?)  Or, for guests who already know the city or have it all figured out or ""just need a place to crash"", that's cool with us too.

As Airbnb guests, we've had fantastic stays with hosts in cities such as San Francisco, Istanbul and Berlin—enjoying the flexible option of the homestay which often beats the generic-faceless hotel-stay (especially when travelling solo), and also for its' much more affordable rate.  We also recognise that Airbnb hosts make excellent guests since they treat homes as if they were our own and take extra care to return everything as it was found.

When not hosting, Brendt, a Traditional Chinese Medicine doctor who also speaks Mandarin fluently, can usually be found whiling an afternoon at the beach with a book, where he's the most happy (having grown up in sunny Queensland). He also bounces to-and-from Goa, India, where he helps manage at a yoga retreat center called Samata in Arambol during the high-peak tourism season for 4-5 months of the year.
