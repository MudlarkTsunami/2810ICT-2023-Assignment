12351,68394,2010-07-24,45760,Anna,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I am hooked! these guys are glorious . The most gracious hosts with generous hearts. Of course they do have many years experience running a BnB in Mudgie so they know the drill but that aside , they were welcoming, friendly, and forthcoming. I don't know Sydney and they do - which was they main reason I wanted to stay with an airbnb host. This is a great way to beat the lonely hotel blues, a great way to get that 'in' on local knowledge. A lovely room to stay in, fresh and clean - a wonderful breakfast early saturday morning before my flight home ( for which I appreciate and am eternally thankful) the fluffiest happiest best behaved dog Kenji i have ever met,  I thoroughly recommend these host and their home to all. . I think we are actually friends now! see you soon"
12351,76453,2010-08-09,148786,Stuart,"As my first AirBnB experience, this was a magnificent introduction. Vinh and Stuart were superb hosts...and Kenji their Pomeranian, was equally enthusiastic but very well-behaved and unobtrusive. Their three-story terrace house was unpretentiously stylish but with a retreat-like, relaxed ambience, warm and light. The location was fantastically close to the essence of Sydney...Darling Harbour, Bay-side parks, the City, Circular Quay; all within an enjoyable walking distance.

In line with the AirBnB concept I felt the way in which we could share time was rich, informative and very flexible. I could come and go as I needed, enjoyed engaged conversation on occasions or the gift of attending to my own thoughts or activities comfortably as desired....A beautiful balance and repose. They also gave me access to their wifi which was great to maintain my internet commitments.

Even though they were often out enjoying to their own social activities Stuart and Vinh ensured that my son (who was occasionally visiting me) and I, felt entirely at home and even cooked us both a delicious breakfast with organic-market bought ingredients the morning I was scheduled to leave. The previous day we'd shared a walk down to the monthly Saturday morning market by the bay. I benefited too from hearing of their travel experiences and valued the opportunity to ask about their business venture...where they help creative people define and empower themselves to 'Make Tomorrow (Website hidden by Airbnb) much so that I've chosen to use their services!

So in essence...I'm very grateful, enthusiastic and inspired by the time spent with Vinh and Stuart and would highly recommend their 'AirBnB' experience.

12351,83283,2010-08-23,190202,Angel,"Like many others this was my first AirBnB experience. I picked their home because it looked so beautiful and well kept.  Their home definitely exceeded my expectations. It was a real bonus when I realized just how close they were to the Darling Harbour.  Although it was only for a day, I felt really welcomed and taken care of. They even had a very yummy custard bun for me upon my arrival. I didn't realize it would be so cold in Sydney this time of year and had only brought a thin hoody.  It was so sweet and caring of Vinh to lend me his jacket for the day.  When I returned after all the sight-seeing, we ended up hanging out and talked the night away. Even though we went to bed quite late, they were kind enough to wake up in the wee hours of the morning just to drive me to the airport! Vinh & Stuart made my stay in Sydney so memorable. I can't even begin to express how much their kindness has touched my heart. I did not feel like just someone renting a room, but rather a visiting friend."
12351,91580,2010-09-06,219308,Meisy,"Vinh and Stuart were very warm and hospitable, they did all they could to make our stay a comfortable one.  We went to the market with their friends and enjoyed a delicious breakfast and lots of interesting conversation.  We had a great time and would recommend them to everyone."
12351,100903,2010-09-20,191976,Dayna,"I had a wonderful experience staying with Vinh and Stuart. They were thoughtful, friendly and warm hosts, very considerate and lovely to chat with. Their home is well located on a street with a great bakery, pubs, small shops, etc., and the guestroom was very peaceful with a skylight and a comfy bed. Breakfasts were fantastic.

Vihn is a great expert on Sydney and was very helpful for advice and suggestions on transport and things to do and see around town. 

Vihn and Stuart are lovely people and really made my stay enjoyable. I would certainly recommend staying with them! "
12351,103486,2010-09-23,34086,Mark,"This was really a great experience.  The house is comfortable, elegant, and I really felt welcomed.  It's very well located and walking distance to Sydney downtown, many attractions, restaurants and pubs.  They were also very helpful with suggestions for places and directions.  Highly recommended!"
12351,109182,2010-10-01,202650,Monica,"Oh my, where do I even start? 

Staying at Vinh and Stu's was definitely the highlight of our Sydney trip.
They were the most welcoming and hospitable hosts anyone could ever dream for. Before we went to Sydney, they sent us a very detailed information pack, that even included the best taxi route from the airport to their home! In short, they are the BEST!

The food and beverage they provided was definitely top quality, and their kitchen was simply amazing and oh so fully equipped. After a healthy and yummy breakfast, we are off to a day of sight-seeing (usually planned with the help of Vinh and Stu), and every night when we come back home we look forward to the interesting conversations with them =)

And I can't praise the apartment enough. The location was simply superb, bus stops literally at the door step, heaps and heaps of cafes and restaurants, and walking distance to the Fish Market!! As you all can see from the photos, they have an absolutely breath-taking apartment. And let me tell you a little secret - the apartment is exactly as gorgeous as the photos are!

If that wasn't enough, I must confess that we seriously considered smuggling Kenji back to Melbourne with us... Hmmm... He is without a doubt the sweetest pup in the entire world. Extremely well behaved, he never barked once, and he just loves to cuddle and cuddle.

Dear Vinh, Stu and Kenji, thank you guys SO much for making our Sydney trip, and firt AirBnB experience simply amazing! Hope to see you guys in Melbourne soon! =)"
12351,117135,2010-10-12,219395,David,"Ditto everything that has been said here about Vinh and Stuart (and of course Kenji, the best behaved Pom I have every met).  They are the consummate hosts and they have a stellar location for exploring Sydney.  We shared two fun evening dinners together.  The experience was exactly what I was hoping for when I signed up for AirBnB-- truly traveling like a human with all of the personal contact and comfort that implies.  I can only hope that the next time my travels take to me Sydney, Vinh and Stuart are still listing their room!  Thank you guys, it was a wonderful experience. "
12351,131079,2010-11-01,195455,Veronika,"My husband and I stayed with Vinh and Stuart during our honeymoon in October 2010. Vinh and Stuart were wonderful hosts to us in their beautiful home, and left us feeling as though we were visiting friends visiting, not strangers in a far away land.

I can't recommend them highly enough.

My husband and I would love the opportunity to visit Sydney again someday, and look forward to seeing Vinh and Stuart when we do."
12351,132574,2010-11-02,270055,Annette & Paul,What an absolute delight to meet Stuart and Vinh.  On arrival we received a very welcome pot of tea and sat chatting for about an hour before retiring.  Vinh was very helpful listening and advising us on our near future venture to build a b&b in Tasmania.  We are looking forward to keeping in touch and learning more through Vinh's business courses.
12351,136299,2010-11-09,269350,Gordon,"I really enjoyed my recent stay with Vinh and Stuart.  They were friendly, welcoming and helped make my stay in Sydney a delight!  They made me dinner one evening and over the course of my four days we had some great conversations about artists, the business of art, food and of course AirBnB.  Staying at their place allowed me to have exactly the low key holiday that I had been hoping for.  Thanks again, guys!  "
12351,141277,2010-11-18,272086,Scott,"Upon my arrival I was warmly greeted with a hot pot of tea, a breakfast pastry, and the affections of Kenji, their adorable pomeranian. After a bit of chatting, Stuart gave me a tour of the house and it's amenities. He even gave me a bus pass with a few rides left on it.

Their comfortable house is immaculately clean and conveniently located. The bus stops just right outside and I was within walking distance of most of the neighborhoods. There are also many restaurants to choose from within a radius of a few blocks. For those traveling without their laptop, they have an extra computer for guests to use.

Stuart and Vinh are exceptional hosts – very friendly, helpful and a delight to talk to. On my next visit to Sydney I would stay with them again in a heartbeat.

Thanks for everything Stuart and Vinh, I couldn't have asked for anything more!"
12351,155431,2010-12-18,310824,Anna,"All three lovely gentlemen (I include Kenji-dog here) were welcoming, easy to talk to, and made my stay a pleasure."
12351,155829,2010-12-19,310824,Anna,"Vinh and Stuart (and Kenji) couldn't have been better hosts. I was an Airbnb virgin and the experience has made me keen to do it again. They're so close to excellent public transport, I got from Pyrmont to the Opera House (including walking for 10 minutes across the forecourt) in under half an hour. Gorgeous bijou residence, no disturbance from neighbours, and just lovely hosts."
12351,156560,2010-12-21,260268,Shirley,"Vinh and Stuart are caring and accommodating hosts.  They went out of their way to make us feel at home and comfortable.  The wifi connection was great and so was the taxi reservation!!  
The information Vinh and Stuart provided before our visit was extremely helpful.  Thanks to these two delightful young men for making our time in Sydney very enjoyable."
12351,159732,2010-12-29,249346,Dee,We really enjoyed our stay with Vinh and Stuart! This was the first time we used AirBNB and it was a great experience. Vinh and Stuart were very welcoming and were happy to tell us anything about Sydney. The house is very modern and artistic from the inside and has a great location.
12351,164763,2011-01-04,194896,Kristian And Youness,"We stayed with Vinh and Stuart over New Years and it was just wonderful. Pure and simple. They are both so friendly and sweet, we had good laughs and they made us feel at ease from the minute we arrived. Great location for Sydney CBD. We can warmly recommend staying with these guys."
12351,167235,2011-01-07,260000,Kristina,"Vinh and Stuart are very good hosts, very nice house, nice breakfast and  a very good location. Lovely dog (Kenji).  They gave me some nice tips about where to go and whats going on in the area. Can really recommend this place for a quick stop over in Sydney.

Kristina"
12351,169641,2011-01-12,205928,Lisa,"We stayed here for 5 days in January last year. The house was everything you could ask for when staying in central Sydney! 

The location for getting around the city was ideal, within walking distance of the city center. The neighborhood is very elegant and close to the Darling Harbour. There you can enjoy a drink and there's a lot of choice from nice restaurants and cosy bars. 

Vinh & Stuart are wonderful hosts! We talked, we laughed, we drank wine, we had a really good time here! Would stay here again anytime!"
12351,171791,2011-01-18,80513,Lars,"We´ve been with Vinh&Stuart for 4 nights in January 2011. Their home is lovely and looks really as shown.  It felt like coming home when they invited us to us their house. And in the evenings, coming back from an exciting day in Sydney,  Vinh was sitting at the table, ""ready"" for a litlle chat. The location is good: Bus stop, Supermarket, Cafe and great Thai across the street; 5 Minutes to Darling Harbour and 10 Minutes to Town Hall. Unfortunately they will move, so we´ve been the last guests. But we hope, they will share their new apt in Sydney also with AirBnB."
12351,180715,2011-02-11,303032,Kim,"Vinh and Stu are awesome hosts! Even their dog, Kenji was perfect - no barking just lots of love. Beautiful and clean home in Pyrmont, quieter then the CBD but literally a few minutes walk from it. Your own balcony, own bathroom really allowed us to have some time to ourselves plus the air conditioning really helped in the sweltering Australian heat. They are quite helpful in regards to answering any of your questions and they welcome you to use their laundry, kitchen and backyard patio as you please. Great guys - friendly, funny and sociable, I will definitely recommend to any of my friends who are looking for a place in Sydney!"
12351,182533,2011-02-15,293562,Wilma,"This was my first airbnb experience and I really enjoyed it. Staying at Stuart and Vinh`s place was excellent. The location is great, close by public transport and restaurants, cafes. It`s only  a 10 min walk to the CBD. Stuart and Vinh are very open and friendly. I definitely recommend staying there."
12351,184011,2011-02-18,329582,May,"We stayed with Vinh and Stuart for 3 days. We're so glad we found airbnb and especially that we stayed with Vinh and Stuart! Not only were they lovely but their home was comfortable and within walking distance to so many places! Vinh was lovely to chat with and even made Troy coffee. As we had a late flight on our last day, Vinh and Stuart were kind enough to let us leave our bags with them until we headed to the airport. Kenji is just as adorable and friendly as all the other comments say he is. If we visit Sydney again, we'd love to stay with Vinh and Stuart once more. "
12351,186619,2011-02-22,351338,Chrissy,"Vinh & Stuart are most lovely hosts very warm and thoughtfull, Their comfy home is in a great location, a 2 min stroll down the road to heaps of lovely resturants so handy after a long day great choices if you want to grab a takeaway or dine in. Nice veiws of the harbour and a 15 min walk to darling harbour. Kenji their little dog is very freindly and very well behaved , I never heard a peep from him and was always there with a happy greeting each day. Great place comfy bed and great aircon. :)"
12351,188663,2011-02-26,344653,David,"I spent a very memorable 3 nights in Sydney with Stuart and Vinh who where friendly, hospitable and excellent hosts…… at ease with their new guest, as I was with them. Their home is just as you see it in the description and photos but the one thing that was really a bonus was the location. If you like walking, then just seconds away you can be walking down steps to the waterfront and passing the finger wharfs on the way to Darling Harbour. If you prefer to use public transport, then the light rail tram is just 2 mins away with a choice of stops. I tended to arrive back late at night but felt completely safe in this area. Just one minute away are several restaurants and my favourite was the Japanese where I had a mix of sushi and sashimi…….all very fresh and served by enthusiastic and dedicated staff. My other favourite dish was breakfast where I was encouraged to just help myself to whatever I fancied in the kitchen. Stuart and Vinh are highly recommended and I have no hesitation in staying there again."
12351,192405,2011-03-05,317160,Beth,"Staying with Vinh and Stu was my husband and my first Airbnb experience, and we have nothing but good things to say about it.  We spent most of our time out and about, but Vinh and Stu were very accomodating with our early mornings and late(ish) nights, and always available with suggestions for the day or encouragement to try Vegemite.  The house was gorgeous and in a great location.  Definitely recommended."
12351,196406,2011-03-11,263945,Paul & Ruth,"We loved our stay at Vinh and Stuarts. From the moment we arrived, they made us feel so so welcome. The house is stunningly decorated and is located perfectly - just a short bus ride or 20 minute walk to Downtown. We enjoyed breakfast out in their garden overlooking the water and, after a day's sightseeing, we looked forward to catching up with our hosts in the evening. We could not have wished for a better - first-time - air bnb experience. "
12351,200392,2011-03-16,354978,Shane,"My vacation in Sydney was a very memorable one. As with any time away from home, accomodation is a huge part of the overall experience. Vinh and Stuart have a great thing going and seem to have a really good handle on providing safe and comfortable lodging to their tourist guests. Their seemed to be no gap between the host and guest. It was one happy family and I especially enjoyed the Pyrmont neighbourhood. I'd surely be a repeat guest. Shane Doucette, Nova Scotia, Canada "
12351,208373,2011-03-25,297196,Matthew,"Vinh and Stu's accommodations are great and they are both amazing hosts. I can't say enough good things about them during my week long stay in Sydney. What I loved about them was after a long day of sight-seeing, coming back to their place was always a fun time, knowing I would see both of them. We would talk for hours about everything from what I did that day to more in depth things like our background, our jobs, our family, our passions, etc. It was much more than just a place to sleep at night. You got a warm, homey, welcoming feeling staying at Vinh and Stu's that you would be extremely hard pressed to find at many 5 star hotels. And on top of that, their Pomeranian Kenji is the sweetest, cutest dog on the face of the earth. If you're a dog lover like I am, you will be at home knowing he will be excited to see you when you come home at night. All in all, I highly recommend Vinh and Stu to anyone thinking of staying in Sydney for business or pleasure. Next time I am back in Sydney, I will stay with Vinh and Stu (and Kenji) in a heartbeat."
12351,210037,2011-03-27,119191,Effie,"Vinh and Stuart are really friendly and helpful hosts. They are always ready for any assist as per your request. They even helped to take our two heavy cases to upstairs. Vinh is really a good friend you can chat with on everything. Every morning you can find everything is in order and clean. You can use the kitchen and laundary as you are at home. The location of the accomodation is quite, safe to close to the city. It took us 15 minutes walk to Gorge St and tram and bus stop are 5 minutes away. Sitting in the living room for breakfast, you can see the harbor from the window and you can walk 2 minutes to touch the sea. The lovely dog Kenji is well behaved and always friendly to anyone. We will stay with Vinh and Stuart once more when we visit Sydney next time. 
Johnston&Effie"
12351,212353,2011-03-29,80688,Rod,"Stayed with Vinh and Stuart for two nights and loved the room ,comfy bed and great setup house ,bathroom,kicthen and view over bay.Vinh and Stuart where very welcoming and helpful with getting around Sydney. We will be staying with them again and reconmended friends to do the same .Thanks guys for a great time.Sandi  and Rod"
12351,215440,2011-04-02,463922,Lisa,Vinh nd Stuart wrote such lovely words about me it is now my turn!!  I felt very very happy to be in their home.  It was my first airbnb experience and these guys were fantastic.  I didnt want to (Website hidden by Airbnb) fact I am going back next week.  Their home is not just a beautiful and gracious abode it is filled with such friendliness and has a great feeling to it which is because these guys are just the best!  Nothing was too much trouble.  Being away on business this was an alternative to soulless hotel rooms for me and at the end of the day it was so lovely to go home!  We had several great conversations and I found them both so interesting and easy to chat with.  If I keep saying nice things everyone will go there and I want to make sure there is a room for me everytime i go to Sydney!!!!  Five stars plus.  Thanks guys. Lisa
12351,219589,2011-04-07,297196,Matthew,"Thanks again Vinh and Stu! I had a lovely time seeing you guys before I jetted out back to the States after my long 3 week holiday. I'm glad you guys enjoyed my photos and after our many conversations about them, I am ready to to pursue my passion and see where it takes me. And I can say now that I have friends' for life in Vinh and Stu. Such great, caring people I was fortunate to cross paths with through AirBnB. I will definitely try to make it back to Sydney in the future and will be staying with you guys in a heartbeat. Thanks again and stay in touch!"
12351,225253,2011-04-13,391689,Katherine,"Staying at Stuart and Vihn's home was my first Airbnb experience and a very positive one. Prior to my arrival,Ii received very detailed directions to their house and other important information. Upon arrival and throughout my stay, they were both very cordial, informative and helpful with making my Sydney experience a positive one. Their condo is beautiful, clean and very strategically located to Darling Harbor. "
12351,230352,2011-04-18,310824,Anna,"A very pleasurable experience: Vinh, Stuart, and Kenji are the perfect hosts. Recommended: sitting on the deck at the back looking out on the bay."
12351,233504,2011-04-20,497546,Arran,"Wonderful spot, with friendly and hospitable hosts."
12351,239059,2011-04-25,470544,Jannifer,"Our stay in Sydney has been great! Vinh+Stuart are such a good host! The location is very convenient..... we can walk to the City, China Town, Fish Market comfortably! It's been great! "
12351,256147,2011-05-09,26917,Robert,"Beautiful accommodation, well placed for getting in to Central Station or walking to Darling Harbour.  Vinh and Stuart were charming hosts."
12351,264115,2011-05-15,472492,Jason,"This was my first airbnb experience (and my first bnb experience) ever. And my gosh, I'll never stay in a hotel in Sydney again if there's a chance I can hang out at Stuart and Vinh's home again. These guys are charming, genuine hosts who seem to have this remarkable ability to give you the exact experience you need. The room and house is wonderful, the bathroom is perfect and the views are sensational. Want to stay in and work? No worries! Feeling like a chat? They are wonderful conversationalists. Want to explore? They'll point you in the right direction. Honestly, I cannot imagine how anyone could be a better host. These guys are generous to the core, and I feel lucky to have met them."
12351,267701,2011-05-17,482586,Laurel,"Vinh and Stuart (and Kenji) are perfect AirBnB hosts-- they provided everything we needed plus some (tidy room, private bath, all amenities) and were there to provide us with friendly advice and conversation while respecting our privacy. We had a wonderful time, and will be staying with them again next time we visit Sydney!"
12351,280946,2011-05-25,358496,Alan,"It was the first time I tried Airbnb. Unlike other hosts here(such as Dylan W), they are responsive to my inquiries. I enjoyed my stay with Vinh+Stuart Horrex. The location is great. You can just walk to the Darling Harbour. The bus stop is just less than a minute walk away that you can take it to the Town Hall & Circular Quay (the Opera House). The house is quiet. Minor things for improvement : more space is needed in the cabinet in the toilet and the wardrobe in the room for guests to put their stuff. 

I was busy travelling and came back late. So I didn't have much time to talk with both hosts. Anyway, they are very nice people. They are flexible about the check in & out time. Therefore I could make full use of my time to rest & travel. And the dog is so cute! To conclude,  I would recommend it to people travelling to Sydney."
12351,285328,2011-05-28,512992,Michael,execellent stay. enjoyed it
12351,295333,2011-06-03,363950,Leila,"This is a great location, especially as i was attending a conference at Darling Harbour - walking distance. Fabulous range of restaurants and cafes steps away - plus a beauty salon on the same street! Easy walk to public transport. On top of all that Vinh and Stuart are perfect hosts - friendly, interesting and informative, yet allowing privacy."
12351,302379,2011-06-07,563382,Bonnie,"Stuart and Vihn are warm, welcoming, and easy going hosts. Its a beautiful home, the location is quiet, villagey and safe, and so so close to the city (you can even walk across Pyrmont Bridge into the CBD). I had a wonderful stay, they made everything so easy, the comfortable room contains all you would need, and bonus - super cute cuddly Pomeranian Kenji!! Would definitely return."
12351,306607,2011-06-10,522057,Damon,"I couldn't have asked for a better first introduction to AirBNB. The hosts were very trusting and flexible in their arrangements for me considering I had to be at a conference at all hours of the day and night. 

The house was warm and homely with full access to the kitchen and coffee making facilities (which I didn't need to use as I had all of that provided at the conference.) 

The location is unbeatable and I walked from Milsons Point back to Pyrmont in only a couple of hours. Very close to the city. 

The bed is comfortable and their is air con if you get cold of a night. 

Why stay in a hotel when you can stay here and get a better experience for the same price!"
12351,315861,2011-06-15,541176,Cate,"We had a great time staying with Vinh and Stuart in Pyrmont. They are very friendly and helpful but don't invade your space.
Their house is lovely and within walking distance of Darling Harbour so makes a great base from which to explore Sydney.
The power was off in their street on our first night, which made going downstairs to the loo in the middle of the night an adventure! But they very kindly gave us a bottle of wine to make up for the inconvenience. We really enjoyed our stay and highly recommend Vinh and Stuart as hosts. Airbnb gives a much richer experience than staying in an impersonal hotel."
12351,326977,2011-06-21,651406,Christopher,Awesome location.  Awesome house.  Awesome room.  Awesome hosts.  Awesome coffee machine! Nuff said ;-)
12351,334788,2011-06-26,470619,Jack,Terrific location and everything was exactly as described.   Vihn & Stuart were great hosts. 
12351,345742,2011-07-01,581533,Kira,"I hate to give Vinh and Stuart a good review because I want to be able to stay with them the next time I need a host in Sydney!  These two gentlemen are simply wonderful and I had a lovely time as a guest in their home.  They are very welcoming and easy to talk with, and their home is simply lovely.  The location is perfect too - very close to the center of Sydney, yet in a quiet neighborhood.  And Kenji the dog is gorgeous.  Vinh and Stu are lucky I didn't take him home with me upon leaving.  :)"
12351,375511,2011-07-16,531667,Suzanne And David,"Thank you to Stuart and Vinh for providing us with such a wonderful home base for our stay in Sydney! They made us feel very welcome and offered excellent advice while we toured the area. We enjoyed our conversations and learning about Australia. The bed was very comfortable, the house is quiet and breakfast was perfect. We would  recommend Stuart and Vinh's highly and without reservation.

Thanks again for everything!!!
Cheers, 
Sue and Dave"
12351,393484,2011-07-24,799731,Mikael,"Our stay in Vinh and Stuart's house was fantastic. They both were very kind, open-minded and helpful. The house is pretty and well located. We really enjoyed staying there and we think that it is the best place to stay in Sydney. We recommend everybody to go there."
12351,416710,2011-08-03,893792,Chris,The host canceled my reservation 120 days before arrival.
12351,433967,2011-08-10,574643,Stephen And Lauran,"Wonderful place to stay, Vinh and Stuart make you feel welcome in their cozy, tastefully appointed home in this peaceful neighborhood. Everything you need is nearby: great restaurants, grocery stores and public transportation. Perfect, to use as a base, to explore Sydney."
12351,442299,2011-08-13,577766,Amantha,"Vinh was a terrific host. He made me feel at home, provided great conversation, and the place was super lovely. Very clean, great location, great views. I would definitely stay there again and would recommend the place to anyone looking for a central (yet quiet) place to stay in Sydney."
12351,469415,2011-08-23,832444,D.,"Beautiful home, fabulous location, wonderful hosts-- this was our first experience with airbnb.com and we couldn't have asked for a better one!  Vinh and Stuart were friendly and welcoming, and they were conscientious hosts as well-- even leaving information (and discounts) to local attractions in our room and calling a cab for us when it was time to go.  They are perfect examples of Australian hospitality and we look forward to staying with them again when we return!   (Plus, their super-friendly, super-quiet, super-adorable little dog is the icing on the cake.) "
12351,480543,2011-08-28,210036,Whitney,"Stuart and Vinh are perfect Airbnb hosts. Their house is lovely--comfortable and inviting and elegant. The location could not be better. It's in a great neighborhood for walking, shopping, and just hanging out. And has good transportation, with a bus, tram, and ferry practically on the doorstep. But, they are the real attraction. They made me feel welcome in every way. We had great conversations, and I feel that I am leaving Sydney with 2 new friends. "
12351,486848,2011-08-30,210036,Whitney,"Lovely hosts. The house is nice, with comfortable spaces and in a great location for exploring Sydney."
12351,493683,2011-09-01,472492,Jason,"Once again, another wonderful stay with Vinh and Stuart (and their gorgeous pomeranian). It's a shame they are such lovely hosts – I really want to spend more time with them. Next time I'll have to stay an extra day, I think. These guys tick all the boxes, and I really can't fault this experience in any way. Everything was perfect, and I'm so happy to have met them. Highly recommended!"
12351,499383,2011-09-04,699802,Ann,"If I travel to Sydney again, Vinh & Stuart will be my top Airbnb choice. "
12351,505328,2011-09-06,639935,Lydia,"Stuart and Vinh are wonderful and very helpful hosts. Their house is beautiful and the view from the terrace and kitchen is amazing. Very convenient for great restaurants and busing to the CBD. The bedroom is lovely and cozy (could've done with a little closet space). Bring your slippers to wear upstairs! Kenji was an added bonus as we missed our dog back in the States. 
Thanks again Stuart and Vinh for adding to the already wonderful experience on our return trip to Sydney.  "
12351,511290,2011-09-07,639935,Lydia,"Stuart and Vinh were wonderful and helpful hosts. A beautiful bedroom warm and cozy. Kitchen facility excellent with lovely view from the terrace off the kitchen. Great restaurants within one block! But for bathroom being downstairs next to the kitchen, I would give this airbnb 5 stars. Loved having Kenji around as we missed our dog back home."
12351,567652,2011-09-26,560163,Robert,"I had an amazing stay with Stuart and Vinh. They were fantastic hosts. Their home is warm and cozy. Loved the nice, modern bathroom and comfortable (Website hidden by Airbnb) were very welcoming and friendly and full of great information about the local area.The neighborhood they live in is filled with wonderful (non-touristy restaurants) and only 5 minutes or less to reach the light rail on foot. Very centrally located. You can walk everywhere or take rail or ferry transport. I would highly recommend staying here and I will too on my return visit to Sydney. P.S. Their little dog Kenji is so cute!!"
12351,588115,2011-10-02,171312,Shaira,2 nice and very helpful guys.  Nice place very close to everything!
12351,605442,2011-10-07,1341761,Durrah,"Vinh & Stuart's (and Kenji's!) home is excellent! The location of the house is just perfect for a walk into the city! Very convenient! Their home is really beautiful, neat and tidy. Just behind their home is Prymont Point Park, and it has such a beautiful skyline- you can see the Harbour Bridge! The hosts were very welcoming and warm, giving lots of help prior and during the stay. Thank you for everything!  "
12351,617811,2011-10-11,564003,Clara-Anne,Stuart & Vinh's home is super central. I recommend it as it is so close to the city. Location is no 1. You can be walking distance from the city & yet it's such a private & quiet spot. not to mention beautiful with the water in front. Kenji ( thier dog ) was a darling & eager to make friends with anyone. We were there for a weekend wedding which was so convenient. We'd return anytime if they're still available. :)
12351,629647,2011-10-16,536811,Steve & Ems,"Vinh and Stu's place s perfectly located for exploring Sydney. Close enough to venture into the city, far enough away to be nice and quiet. The views out the back of the house are fantastic and the house is within an easy 10 minute walk of Darling Harbour with all its bars, restaurants and shops.
Vinh and Stu are fantastic hosts, they are an easy laid back pair who are great to talk to and incredibly accommodating with lots of advice on the city to share.
I would highly recommend Vinh and Stu and when we return to Sydney we will certainly look them up again."
12351,640603,2011-10-18,460285,Donna,"As they say in New York, Location, Location, Location!  Whether you are a walker or prefer public transportation, it is easy to walk or use the tram/bus to the common places like Darling Harbour, downtown Sydney, etc.  Vinh and Stuart go out of their way to make sure you have the information to get around.  On a personal note, Vinh showed me how my travel blog could connect with website.  His enthusiasm got me off my tush and start writing again!  I slept in the upstairs room (and the bed is very comfortable) and later when my husband came, the second floor room.  You do have to be prepared to go to the first floor for a night time bathroom run but other than that, it's perfect!"
12351,661898,2011-10-25,691946,Mark,To say that it exceeded our expectations is a gross understatement! Rarely have stayed anywhere that we felt more part of the family and were treated so well. If you stay anywhere else when you visit Sydney you will be missing out on one of the cities main attractions. Thank you guys for making our precious holiday time so special.
12351,667979,2011-10-27,907777,Karyn,"Vinh & Stuart were perfect hosts, friendly and not intrusive.  We felt like we were staying with old friends.  Vinh & Stuart kindly helped us up the stairs with our baggage.  Plenty of choice re tea/coffee.  Plentiful supply of breakfast foods.  Comfortable and private room.  Great location and close to transport.  Vinh told us of the local's secret, the Fish Market, where we enjoyed a sumpuous seafood meal.  This was our first experience of Air BnB and it certainly was very positive, we will certainly stay here again when back in Sydney.  Great value."
12351,705142,2011-11-09,487908,Jason And Brett,"Vinh & Stuart were absolutely delightful hosts. A lovely home and a lovely atmosphere. Well positioned and appointed. We couldn't have asked for more. Thanks very much, we look forward to staying again :) "
12351,712869,2011-11-13,844345,Alan,Only stayed for a couple of nights but were made to feel most welcome. Location was excellent with a great local pub. Both Vin & Stuart were excellent hosts but very much just let you get on with things and offered advice and help about Sydney if you needed it. I would highly recommend staying with them.
12351,725677,2011-11-17,888499,Dirk,"Mal auf Deutsch: Der Aufenthalt bei den beiden war insgesamt sehr harmonisch, wir freuten uns vor allem an dem Blick von der kleinen Terasse auf das Wasser. Die Küche ist - de facto - nicht für die Nutzung durch andere gedacht. Aber ansonsten war alles zu unserer Zufriedenheit."
12351,736782,2011-11-22,645929,Mike&Jacquie,"We would just like to thank Vinh & Stuart for making our 1st Airbnb such an easy & enjoyable experience, we felt that Vinh went out of his way to give us advise during our holiday and found them both to be extremely kind and genuine hosts who we would not hesitiate to stay with again, thank you again for your making us feel so comfortable in your lovely home.
Mike & Jacquie"
12351,743780,2011-11-25,1427081,Harbour,Great BnB in a funky area of Sydney.  Excellent light rail or bus transport to the CBD.  Vinh & Stuart were very hospitable.  The room is bright with a very comfortable bed.  
12351,778603,2011-12-12,1265378,Leanne,"This was my first Airbnb stay and am keen to do it again after such a great experience. The hosts were wonderful, as was the view! They provided us with directions around the places we needed to go and assisted us with public transport information. They were very accommodating and made myself and my friend feel at home. We had a very busy schedule and unfortunately didn't get to spend much time in there lovely apartment. It was immaculate, with full kitchen use, own bathroom, WIFI connection, a comfortable bed after a busy day and a key to come and go as we needed. Thanks Guys! (And special mention to the Pomeranian who was just so cute :)"
12351,786133,2011-12-15,667718,Jin,"We had a wonderful stay with Vinh (Stuart was out on business). Their house is tastefully decorated with a view to the water, clean, comfortable, and easy access to the city center. Vinh is very friendly and helpful with good advice how to go about the city. We enjoyed our stay and conversation with him, and have no hestation to recommend their house to our friends. And we hope we'll visit them again."
12351,799152,2011-12-22,825306,James,"We found Vinh and Stuart to be delightful hosts, and my wife fell in love with their dog ""Kenji"", their sweet and quiet Pomeranian.  He really helped her overcome the longing she had for our dog waiting for our return.

The flat is in an excellent location and we would recommend these accommodations to anyone looking for an authentic Sydney experience.

Thank you Vinh & Stuart for helping to make this an unforgettable trip.

Jim & Sari"
